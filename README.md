# NetDevOps Testing Pipeline
This repo is the code for my dissertation exploring NetDevOps and its useage within a network CI/CD pipeline.

The main aim of the project was to test if it was possible to make safe and tested network changes before the changes were deployed to production.

The project contains a Lan implementation for this testing framework (using GNS3 for simulating the network")
and code for a cloud implementation using Azure cloud.
